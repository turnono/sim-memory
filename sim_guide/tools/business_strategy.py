Business Strategy Tools

Tools for interacting with the Business Strategist agent and its sub-agents.
These tools follow the context-passing approach where the root agent curates
relevant context and passes it to the Business Strategist. ADK automatically
handles delegation to specialized sub-agents based on the query type.
